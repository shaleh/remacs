# Rust + Emacs

An experiment in compiling Rust with C.

GPLv3, just like all Emacs code.

## Building

You need to use nightly rust.

```
$ rustup override set nightly
$ cargo build --release
```

## TODOC

* Building (as described in
  https://bawk.space/2016/10/06/c-to-rust.html )
* Overriding git hooks (just delete them?)
