* Changes in Emacs 26.3

** New option 'help-enable-completion-auto-load'.
This allows disabling the new feature introduced in Emacs 26.1 which
loads files during completion of 'C-h f' and 'C-h v' according to
'definition-prefixes'.

** Emacs now supports the new Japanese Era name.
The newly assigned codepoint U+32FF was added to the Unicode Character
Database compiled into Emacs.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 26.2

** Building Emacs with the '--with-xwidgets' option now requires WebKit2.
To build Emacs with xwidgets support, you will need to install the
webkit2gtk-4.0 package; version 2.12 or later is required.
(This change was actually made in Emacs 26.1, but was not called out
in its NEWS.)

** Installing Emacs now installs the emacs-module.h file.
The emacs-module.h file is now installed in the system-wide include
directory as part of the Emacs installation.  This allows to build
Emacs modules outside of the Emacs source tree.


* Changes in Emacs 26.2

** Emacs is now compliant with the latest version 11.0 of the Unicode Standard.

** New variable 'xft-ignore-color-fonts'.
Default t means don't try to load color fonts when using Xft, as they
often cause crashes.  Set it to nil if you really need those fonts.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 26.2

** Dired

*** The 'Z' command on a directory name compresses all of its files.
It produces a compressed '.tar.gz' archive with all the files in the
directory and all of its subdirectories.  For symmetry, 'Z' on a
'.tar.gz' or a '.tgz' archive extracts all the archived files into the
current directory; thus, typing 'Z' on a '.tar.gz' archive created by
a previous 'Z' command will extract the archived files into a
directory whose name is the archive name sans the '.tar.gz' extension.
(This change was actually made in Emacs 25.1 but was only
partially called out in its NEWS; 'tgz' handling was added in 26.1.)

** Ibuffer

*** New toggle 'ibuffer-do-toggle-lock', bound to 'L'.

** Imenu

*** The value for 'imenu-auto-rescan-maxout' has been increased to 600000.

** Gnus

*** Mailutils movemail will now be used if found at runtime.
The default value of 'mail-source-movemail-program' is now "movemail".
This ensures that the movemail program from GNU Mailutils will be used
if found in 'exec-path', even if it was not found at build time.  To
use a different program, customize 'mail-source-movemail-program' to the
absolute file name of the desired executable.

** Shadowfile

*** shadowfile.el has been rewritten to support Tramp file names.

** Shell mode

*** Shell mode buffers now have 'scroll-conservatively' set to 101.
This is so as to better emulate the scrolling behavior of a text
terminal when new output is added to the screen buffer.  To get back
the previous behavior, reset 'scroll-conservatively' to zero (or any
other value you like) in a function and add it to 'shell-mode-hook'.
(This change was actually made in Emacs 26.1, but was not called out
in its NEWS.)

** VC

*** VC support for Mercurial was improved.
Emacs now avoids invoking 'hg' as much as possible, for faster operation.
(This and the following changes were actually made in Emacs 26.1, but
were not called out in its NEWS.)

**** New vc-hg options.
The new option 'vc-hg-parse-hg-data-structures' controls whether vc-hg
will try parsing the Mercurial data structures directly instead of
running 'hg'; it defaults to t (set to nil if you want the pre-26.1
behavior).
The new option 'vc-hg-symbolic-revision-styles' controls how versions
in a Mercurial repository are presented symbolically on the mode line.
The new option 'vc-hg-use-file-version-for-mode-line-version' controls
whether the version shown on the mode line is that of the visited file
or of the repository working copy.

**** Display of Mercurial revisions in the mode line has changed.
Previously, the mode line displayed the local number (1, 2, 3, ...) of
the revision.  Starting with Emacs 26.1, the default has changed, and
it now shows the global revision number, in the form of its changeset
hash value.  To get back the previous behavior, customize the new
option 'vc-hg-symbolic-revision-styles' to the value '("{rev}")'.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 26.2

** shadowfile config files have changed their syntax.
Existing files "~/.emacs.d/shadows" and "~/.emacs.d/shadow_todo" must
be removed prior using the changed 'shadow-*' commands.

** 'thread-alive-p' has been renamed to 'thread-live-p'.
The old name is an alias of the new name.  Future Emacs version will
obsolete it.

** 'while-no-input' does not return due to input from subprocesses.
Input that arrived from subprocesses while some code executed inside
the 'while-no-input' form injected an internal buffer-switch event
that counted as input and would cause 'while-no-input' to return,
perhaps prematurely.  These buffer-switch events are now by default
ignored by 'while-no-input'; if you need to get the old behavior,
remove 'buffer-switch' from the list of events in
'while-no-input-ignore-events'.

** The new configure option '--with-json' adds support for JSON using
the Jansson library.  It is on by default; use 'configure
--with-json=no' to build without Jansson support.  The new JSON
functions 'json-serialize', 'json-insert', 'json-parse-string', and
'json-parse-buffer' are typically much faster than their Lisp
counterparts from json.el.

** Emacs has been ported to the -fcheck-pointer-bounds option of GCC.
This causes Emacs to check bounds of some arrays addressed by its
internal pointers, which can be helpful when debugging the Emacs
interpreter or modules that it uses.  If your platform supports it you
can enable it when configuring, e.g., './configure CFLAGS="-g3 -O2
-mmpx -fcheck-pointer-bounds"' on Intel MPX platforms.

** Emacs now normally uses a C pointer type instead of a C integer
type to implement Lisp_Object, which is the fundamental machine word
type internal to the Emacs Lisp interpreter.  This change aims to
catch typos and support -fcheck-pointer-bounds.  The 'configure'
option --enable-check-lisp-object-type is therefore no longer as
useful and so is no longer enabled by default in developer builds,
to reduce differences between developer and production builds.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 26.2

** The new function 'read-answer' accepts either long or short answers
depending on the new customizable variable 'read-answer-short'.

** New function 'assoc-delete-all'.
Like 'assq-delete-all', but uses 'equal' for comparison.

** The function 'thing-at-point' behaves as before Emacs 26.1.
The behavior of 'thing-at-point' when called with argument 'list' has
changed in Emacs 26.1, in that it didn't consider text inside comments
and strings as a potential list.  This change is now reverted, and
'thing-at-point' behaves like it did before Emacs 26.1.

** To cater to use cases where comments and strings are to be ignored
when looking for a list, the function 'list-at-point' now takes an
optional argument to do so.

+++
** Emacs can now be configured using an early init file.
The file is called 'early-init.el', in 'user-emacs-directory'.  It is
loaded very early in the startup process: before graphical elements
such as the tool bar are initialized, and before the package manager
is initialized.  The primary purpose is to allow customizing how the
package system is initialized given that initialization now happens
before loading the regular init file (see below).

+++
** Emacs now calls 'package-initialize' before loading the init file.
This is part of a change intended to eliminate the behavior of
package.el inserting a call to 'package-initialize' into the init
file, which was previously done when Emacs was started.  As a result
of this change, it is no longer necessary to call 'package-initialize'
in your init file.  However, if your init file changes the values of
'package-load-list' or 'package-user-dir', then that code needs to be
moved to the early init file (see above).

* Changes in Emacs 26.2 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** macOS features can now be detected at run-time as well as at
build-time.  See nextstep/INSTALL for details.
(This change was actually made in Emacs 26.1, but was undocumented and
not called out in its NEWS.)

---
** The new option 'tooltip-resize-echo-area' avoids truncating tooltip text
on GUI frames when tooltips are displayed in the echo area.  Instead,
it resizes the echo area as needed to accommodate the full tool-tip
text.

---
** Show modeline tooltips only if the corresponding action applies.
Customize the option 'mode-line-default-help-echo' to restore the old
behavior where the tooltip text is also shown when the corresponding
action does not apply.

+++
** New hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook'.
This hook is a convenient place to perform initializations in daemon
mode which require GUI features to be available.  One example is
restoration of the previous session using the desktop.el package: put
the call to 'desktop-read' in this hook, if you want the GUI settings
to be restored, or if desktop.el needs to interact with you during
restoration of the session.

+++
** New function 'logcount' calculates an integer's Hamming weight.

+++
** New function 'libxml-available-p'.
This function returns non-nil if libxml support is both compiled in
and available at run time.  Lisp programs should use this function to
detect built-in libxml support, instead of testing for that
indirectly, e.g., by checking that functions like
'libxml-parse-html-region' return nil.

+++
** New function 'fill-polish-nobreak-p', to be used in 'fill-nobreak-predicate'.
It blocks line breaking after a one-letter word, also in the case when
this word is preceded by a non-space, but non-alphanumeric character.

+++
** The limit on repetitions in regexps has been raised to 2^16-1.
It was previously limited to 2^15-1.  For example, the following
regular expression was previously invalid, but is now accepted:

   x\{32768\}


* Installation Changes in Emacs 26.1

** By default libgnutls is now required when building Emacs.
Use 'configure --with-gnutls=no' to build even when GnuTLS is missing.

** GnuTLS version 2.12.2 or later is now required, instead of merely
version 2.6.6 or later.

** The new option 'configure --with-mailutils' causes Emacs to rely on
GNU Mailutils to retrieve email.  It is recommended, and is the
default if GNU Mailutils is installed.  When --with-mailutils is not
in effect, the Emacs build procedure by default continues to build and
install a limited 'movemail' substitute that retrieves POP3 email only
via insecure channels; to avoid this problem, use either
--with-mailutils or --without-pop when configuring.

** The new option 'configure --enable-gcc-warnings=warn-only' causes
GCC to issue warnings without stopping the build.  This behavior is
now the default in developer builds.  As before, use
'--disable-gcc-warnings' to suppress GCC's warnings, and
'--enable-gcc-warnings' to stop the build if GCC issues warnings.

** When GCC warnings are enabled, '--enable-check-lisp-object-type' is
now enabled by default when configuring.

+++
** The Emacs server now has socket-launching support.  This allows
socket based activation, where an external process like systemd can
invoke the Emacs server process upon a socket connection event and
hand the socket over to Emacs.  Emacs uses this socket to service
emacsclient commands.  This new functionality can be disabled with the
configure option '--disable-libsystemd'.

+++
** A systemd user unit file is provided.  Use it in the standard way:
systemctl --user enable emacs
(If your Emacs is installed in a non-standard location, you may
need to copy the emacs.service file to eg ~/.config/systemd/user/)

** New configure option '--disable-build-details' attempts to build an
Emacs that is more likely to be reproducible; that is, if you build
and install Emacs twice, the second Emacs is a copy of the first.
Deterministic builds omit the build date from the output of the
'emacs-version' and 'erc-cmd-SV' functions, and the leave the
following variables nil: 'emacs-build-system', 'emacs-build-time',
'erc-emacs-build-time'.

+++
** New isearch bindings.
'C-M-w' in isearch changed from isearch-del-char to the new function
isearch-yank-symbol-or-char. isearch-del-char is now bound to 'C-M-d'.

+++
** New isearch bindings.
'C-M-w' in isearch changed from isearch-del-char to the new function
isearch-yank-symbol-or-char. isearch-del-char is now bound to 'C-M-d'.

---
** Emacs can now be built with support for Little CMS.

+++
** New user option 'electric-quote-replace-double'.
This option controls whether '"' is replaced in 'electric-quote-mode',
in addition to other quote characters.  If non-nil, ASCII double-quote
characters that quote text "like this" are replaced by double
typographic quotes, “like this”, in text modes, and in comments in
non-text modes.

---
** 'write-abbrev-file' now includes special properties.
'write-abbrev-file' now writes special properties like ':case-fixed'
for abbrevs that have them.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 27.1

** Ecomplete
*** The ecomplete sorting has changed to a decay-based algorithm.
This can be controlled by the new `ecomplete-sort-predicate' variable.

*** The 'ecompleterc' file is now placed in ~/.emacs.d/ecompleterc by default
Of course it will still find it if you have it in ~/.ecompleterc

** Gnus
*** The function 'gnus-score-find-favorite-words' has been renamed
from 'gnus-score-find-favourite-words'.

** Htmlfontify
*** The functions 'hfy-color', 'hfy-color-vals' and
'hfy-fallback-color-values' and the variables 'hfy-fallback-color-map'
and 'hfy-rgb-txt-color-map' have been renamed from names that used
'colour' instead of 'color'.

** Smtpmail
Authentication mechanisms can be added via external packages, by
defining new cl-defmethod of smtpmail-try-auth-method.

** Footnote-mode
*** Support Hebrew-style footnotes
*** Footnote text lines are now aligned.
Can be controlled via the new variable 'footnote-align-to-fn-text'.

** CSS mode

---
*** A new command 'css-cycle-color-format' for cycling between color
formats (e.g. "black" => "#000000" => "rgb(0, 0, 0)") has been added,
bound to 'C-c C-f'.

** Dired

+++
*** The new user option 'dired-create-destination-dirs' controls whether
'dired-do-copy' and 'dired-rename-file' should create non-existent
directories in the destination.

** Help

---
*** Output format of 'C-h l' (view-lossage) has changed.
For convenience, 'view-lossage' now displays the last keystrokes
and commands in the same format as the edit buffer of
'edit-last-kbd-macro'.  This makes it possible to copy the lines from
the buffer generated by 'view-lossage' to the "*Edit Macro*" buffer
created by 'edit-last-kbd-macro', and to save the macro by 'C-c C-c'.

** Ibuffer

---
*** New filter ibuffer-filter-by-process; bound to '/E'.

** Search and Replace

*** 'search-exit-option' provides new options 'move' and 'shift-move'
to extend the search string by yanking text that ends at the new
position after moving point in the current buffer.  'shift-move'
extends the search string by motion commands while holding down
the shift key.

** Edebug

+++
*** The runtime behavior of Edebug's instrumentation can be changed
using the new variables 'edebug-behavior-alist',
'edebug-after-instrumentation-function' and
'edebug-new-definition-function'. Edebug's behavior can be changed
globally or for individual definitions.

** Enhanced xterm support

*** New variable 'xterm-set-window-title' controls whether Emacs sets
the XTerm window title.  This feature is experimental and is disabled
by default.

** Gamegrid

** grep

*** rgrep, lgrep and zrgrep now hide part of the command line
that contains a list of ignored directories and files.
Clicking on the button with ellipsis unhides it.
The abbreviation can be disabled by the new option
'grep-find-abbreviate'.  The new command
'grep-find-toggle-abbreviation' toggles it interactively.

** ERT

+++
*** New variable 'ert-quiet' allows to make ERT output in batch mode
less verbose by removing non-essential information.

---
*** Gamegrid now determines its default glyph size based on display
dimensions, instead of always using 16 pixels. As a result, Tetris,
Snake and Pong are more playable on HiDPI displays.

** Filecache

---
*** Completing filenames in the minibuffer via 'C-TAB' now uses the
styles as configured by the variable 'completion-styles'.

** New macros 'thunk-let' and 'thunk-let*'.
These macros are analogue to 'let' and 'let*', but create bindings that
are evaluated lazily.

** next-error

*** New customizable variable next-error-find-buffer-function
defines the logic of finding a next-error capable buffer.
It has an option to use a single such buffer on selected frame, or
by default use the last buffer that navigated to the current buffer.

** Eshell

---
*** Expansion of history event designators is disabled by default.
To restore the old behavior, use

    (add-hook 'eshell-expand-input-functions
              #'eshell-expand-history-references)

*** The function 'shell-uniquify-list' has been renamed from
'eshell-uniqify-list'.

** Pcomplete
*** The function 'pcomplete-uniquify-list' has been renamed from
'pcomplete-uniqify-list'.

** Tramp

+++
*** New connection method "owncloud", which allows to access OwnCloud
or NextCloud hosted files and directories.

---
** The options.el library has been removed.
It was obsolete since Emacs 22.1, replaced by customize.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 26.1

+++
** Emacs can now visit files in archives as if they were directories.
This feature uses Tramp and works only on systems which support GVFS,
i.e. GNU/Linux, roughly spoken.  See the chapter "(tramp) Archive file
names" in the Tramp manual for full documentation of these facilities.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 27.1

** The FILENAME argument to 'file-name-base' is now mandatory and no
longer defaults to 'buffer-file-name'.

---
** The function 'eldoc-message' now accepts a single argument.
Programs that called it with multiple arguments before should pass
them through 'format' first.  Even that is discouraged: for ElDoc
support, you should set 'eldoc-documentation-function' instead of
calling 'eldoc-message' directly.

** Old-style backquotes now generate an error.  They have been
generating warnings for a decade.  To interpret old-style backquotes
as new-style, bind the new variable 'force-new-style-backquotes' to t.

** Defining a Common Lisp structure using 'cl-defstruct' or
'cl-struct-define' whose name clashes with a builtin type (e.g.,
'integer' or 'hash-table') now signals an error.

** When formatting a floating-point number as an octal or hexadecimal
integer, Emacs now signals an error if the number is too large for the
implementation to format (Bug#30408).

---
** Some functions and variables obsolete since Emacs 22 have been removed:
archive-mouse-extract, assoc-ignore-case, assoc-ignore-representation,

* Lisp Changes in Emacs 27.1

+++
** New function assoc-delete-all.

** 'print-quoted' now defaults to t, so if you want to see
(quote x) instead of 'x you will have to bind it to nil where applicable.

** To avoid confusion caused by "smart quotes", the reader signals an
error when reading Lisp symbols which begin with one of the following
quotation characters: ‘’‛“”‟〞＂＇.  A symbol beginning with such a
character can be written by escaping the quotation character with a
backslash.  For example:

    (read "‘smart") => (invalid-read-syntax "strange quote" "‘")
    (read "\\‘smart") == (intern "‘smart")

** Internal parsing commands now use syntax-ppss and disregard
open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start.  This affects mostly things like
forward-comment, scan-sexps, and forward-sexp when parsing backward.
The new variable 'comment-use-syntax-ppss' can be set to nil to recover the old
behavior if needed.

** The `server-name' and `server-socket-dir' variables are set when a
socket has been pased to Emacs (Bug#24218).

---
** The 'file-system-info' function is now available on all platforms.
instead of just Microsoft platforms.  This fixes a 'get-free-disk-space'
bug on OS X 10.8 and later (Bug#28639).

---
** The function 'get-free-disk-space' returns now a non-nil value for
remote systems, which support this check.

+++
** The function 'make-string' accepts an additional optional argument.
If the optional third argument is non-nil, 'make-string' will produce
a multibyte string even if its second argument is an ASCII character.

** (format "%d" X) no longer mishandles a floating-point number X that
does not fit in a machine integer (Bug#30408).

** New JSON parsing and serialization functions 'json-serialize',
'json-insert', 'json-parse-string', and 'json-parse-buffer'.  These
are implemented in C using the Jansson library.

---
** The new function `mailcap-file-name-to-mime-type' has been added.
It's a simple convenience function for looking up MIME types based on
file name extensions.

+++
** The new function 'read-answer' accepts either long or short answers
depending on the new customizable variable 'read-answer-short'.

** The function 'load' now behaves correctly when loading modules.
Specifically, it puts the module name into 'load-history', prints
loading messages if requested, and protects against recursive loads.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 26.1

---
** New function `cl-generic-p'.

** Dired

+++
*** You can answer 'all' in 'dired-do-delete' to delete recursively all
remaining directories without more prompts.

+++
*** Dired supports wildcards in the directory part of the file names.

+++
*** You can now use '`?`' in 'dired-do-shell-command'.
It gets replaced by the current file name, like ' ? '.

+++
*** A new option 'dired-always-read-filesystem' default to nil.
If non-nil, buffers visiting files are reverted before search them;
for instance, in 'dired-mark-files-containing-regexp' a non-nil value
of this option means the file is revisited in a temporary buffer;
this temporary buffer is the actual buffer searched: the original buffer
visiting the file is not modified.

---
*** Users can now customize mouse clicks in Dired in a more flexible way.
The new command 'dired-mouse-find-file' can be bound to a mouse click
and used to visit files/directories in Dired in the selected window.
The new command 'dired-mouse-find-file-other-frame' similarly visits
files/directories in another frame.  You can write your own commands
that invoke 'dired-mouse-find-file' with non-default optional
arguments, to tailor the effects of mouse clicks on file names in
Dired buffers.

+++
*** In wdired, when editing files to contain slash characters,
the resulting directories are automatically created.  Whether to do
this is controlled by the 'wdired-create-parent-directories' variable.

+++
*** 'W' is now bound to 'browse-url-of-dired-file', and is useful for
viewing HTML files and the like.

---
*** New variable 'dired-clean-confirm-killing-deleted-buffers'
controls whether Dired asks to kill buffers visiting deleted files and
directories.  The default is t, so Dired asks for confirmation, to
keep previous behavior.

---
** html2text is now marked obsolete.

---
** smerge-refine-regions can refine regions in separate buffers

---
** Info menu and index completion uses substring completion by default.
This can be customized via the info-menu category in
completion-category-override.

+++
** The ancestor buffer is shown by default in 3-way merges.
A new option ediff-show-ancestor and a new toggle
ediff-toggle-show-ancestor.

---
** TeX: Add luatex and xetex as alternatives to pdftex

** Electric-Buffer-menu

+++
*** Key 'U' is bound to 'Buffer-menu-unmark-all' and key 'M-DEL' is
bound to 'Buffer-menu-unmark-all-buffers'.

** bs

---
*** Two new commands 'bs-unmark-all', bound to 'U', and
'bs-unmark-previous', bound to <backspace>.

** Buffer-menu

+++
*** Two new commands 'Buffer-menu-unmark-all', bound to 'U' and
'Buffer-menu-unmark-all-buffers', bound to 'M-DEL'.

---
** Checkdoc

*** 'checkdoc-arguments-in-order-flag' now defaults to nil.

** Gnus

---
*** The .newsrc file will now only be saved if the native select
method is an NNTP select method.

+++
*** A new command for sorting articles by readedness marks has been
added: 'C-c C-s C-m C-m'.

+++

*** In message-citation-line-format the %Z format is now the time zone name
instead of the numeric form.  The %z format continues to be the
numeric form.  The new behavior is compatible with format-time-string.

** Ibuffer

---
*** New command 'ibuffer-jump'.

---
*** New filter commands 'ibuffer-filter-by-basename',
'ibuffer-filter-by-file-extension', 'ibuffer-filter-by-directory',
'ibuffer-filter-by-starred-name', 'ibuffer-filter-by-modified'
and 'ibuffer-filter-by-visiting-file'; bound respectively
to '/b', '/.', '//', '/*', '/i' and '/v'.

---
*** Two new commands 'ibuffer-filter-chosen-by-completion'
and 'ibuffer-and-filter', the second bound to '/&'.

---
*** The commands 'ibuffer-pop-filter', 'ibuffer-pop-filter-group',
'ibuffer-or-filter' and 'ibuffer-filter-disable' have the alternative
bindings '/<up>', '/S-<up>', '/|' and '/DEL', respectively.

---
*** The data format specifying filters has been extended to allow
explicit logical 'and', and a more flexible form for logical 'not'.
See 'ibuffer-filtering-qualifiers' doc string for full details.

---
*** A new command 'ibuffer-copy-buffername-as-kill'; bound
to 'B'.

---
*** New command 'ibuffer-change-marks'; bound to '* c'.

---
*** A new command 'ibuffer-mark-by-locked' to mark
all locked buffers;  bound to '% L'.

---
*** A new option 'ibuffer-locked-char' to indicate
locked buffers; Ibuffer shows a new column displaying
'ibuffer-locked-char' for locked buffers.

---
*** A new command 'ibuffer-unmark-all-marks' to unmark
all buffers without asking confirmation;  bound to
'U'; 'ibuffer-do-replace-regexp' bound to 'r'.

---
*** A new command 'ibuffer-mark-by-content-regexp' to mark buffers
whose content matches a regexp; bound to '% g'.

---
*** Two new options 'ibuffer-never-search-content-name' and
'ibuffer-never-search-content-mode' used by
'ibuffer-mark-by-content-regexp'.

** Browse-URL

---
*** Support for opening links to man pages in Man or WoMan mode.

** Comint

---
*** New user option 'comint-move-point-for-matching-input' to control
where to place point after C-c M-r and C-c M-s.

** Compilation mode

---
*** Messages from CMake are now recognized.

+++
*** The number of errors, warnings, and informational messages is now
displayed in the mode line.  These are updated as compilation
proceeds.

** Grep

---
*** Grep commands will now use GNU grep's '--null' option if
available, which allows distinguishing the filename from contents if
they contain colons.  This can be controlled by the new custom option
'grep-use-null-filename-separator'.

---
*** The grep/rgrep/lgrep functions will now ask about saving files
before running.  This is controlled by the 'grep-save-buffers'
variable.

** Edebug

---
*** Edebug can be prevented from pausing 1 second after reaching a
breakpoint (e.g. with "f" and "o") by customizing the new option
'edebug-sit-on-break'.

+++
*** New customizable option 'edebug-max-depth'
This allows to enlarge the maximum recursion depth when instrumenting
code.

** Eshell

---
*** 'eshell-input-filter's value is now a named function
'eshell-input-filter-default', and has a new custom option
'eshell-input-filter-initial-space' to ignore adding commands prefixed
with blank space to eshell history.

** eww

+++
*** New 'M-RET' command for opening a link at point in a new eww buffer.

+++
*** A new 's' command for switching to another eww buffer via the minibuffer.

---
*** The 'o' command ('shr-save-contents') has moved to 'O' to avoid collision
with the 'o' command from 'image-map'.

+++
*** A new command 'C' ('eww-toggle-colors') can be used to toggle
whether to use the HTML-specified colors or not.  The user can also
customize the 'shr-use-colors' variable.

---
*** Images that are being loaded are now marked with gray
"placeholder" images of the size specified by the HTML.  They are then
replaced by the real images asynchronously, which will also now
respect width/height HTML specs (unless they specify widths/heights
bigger than the current window).

---
*** The 'w' command on links is now 'shr-maybe-probe-and-copy-url'.
'shr-copy-url' now only copies the url at point; users who wish to
avoid accidentally accessing remote links may rebind 'w' and 'u' in
'eww-link-keymap' to it.


** Ido

---
*** The commands 'find-alternate-file-other-window',
'dired-other-window', 'dired-other-frame', and
'display-buffer-other-window' are now remapped to Ido equivalents if
Ido mode is active.

** Images

+++
*** Images are automatically scaled before displaying based on the
'image-scaling-factor' variable (if Emacs supports scaling the images
in question).

+++
*** It's now possible to specify aspect-ratio preserving combinations
of :width/:max-height and :height/:max-width keywords.  In either
case, the "max" keywords win.  (Previously some combinations would,
depending on the aspect ratio of the image, just be ignored and in
other instances this would lead to the aspect ratio not being
preserved.)

+++
*** Images inserted with 'insert-image' and related functions get a
keymap put into the text properties (or overlays) that span the
image.  This keymap binds keystrokes for manipulating size and
rotation, as well as saving the image to a file.  These commands are
also available in 'image-mode'.

+++
*** A new library for creating and manipulating SVG images has been
added.  See the "SVG Images" section in the Lisp reference manual for
details.

+++
*** New setf-able function to access and set image parameters is
provided: 'image-property'.

---
*** New commands 'image-scroll-left' and 'image-scroll-right'
for 'image-mode' that complement 'image-scroll-up' and
'image-scroll-down': they have the same prefix arg behavior and stop
at image boundaries.

** Image-Dired

---
*** Now provides a minor mode 'image-dired-minor-mode' which replaces
the function 'image-dired-setup-dired-keybindings'.

---
*** Thumbnail generation is now asynchronous.
The number of concurrent processes is limited by the variable
'image-dired-thumb-job-limit'.

---
*** 'image-dired-thumbnail-storage' has a new option 'standard-large'
for generating 256x256 thumbnails according to the Thumbnail Managing
Standard.

---
*** Inherits movement keys from 'image-mode' for viewing full images.
This includes the usual char, line, and page movement commands.

---
*** All the -options types have been changed to argument lists
instead of shell command strings.  This change affects
'image-dired-cmd-create-thumbnail-options',
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-options',
'image-dired-cmd-rotate-thumbnail-options',
'image-dired-cmd-rotate-original-options',
'image-dired-cmd-write-exif-data-options',
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-options', and introduces
'image-dired-cmd-pngnq-options', 'image-dired-cmd-pngcrush-options',
'image-dired-cmd-create-standard-thumbnail-options'

---
*** Recognizes more tools by default, including pngnq-s9 and OptiPNG

---
*** 'find-file' and related commands now work on thumbnails and
displayed images, providing a default argument of the original file name
via an addition to 'file-name-at-point-functions'.

---
** The default 'Info-default-directory-list' no longer checks some obsolete
directory suffixes (gnu, gnu/lib, gnu/lib/emacs, emacs, lib, lib/emacs)
when searching for info directories.

+++
** The commands that add ChangeLog entries now prefer a VCS root directory
for the ChangeLog file, if none already exists.  Customize
'change-log-directory-files' to nil for the old behavior.

---
** Support for non-string values of 'time-stamp-format' has been removed.

** Message

---
*** 'message-use-idna' now defaults to t (because Emacs comes with
built-in IDNA support now).

---
*** When sending HTML messages with embedded images, and you have
exiftool installed, and you rotate images with EXIF data (i.e.,
JPEGs), the rotational information will be inserted into the outgoing
image in the message.  (The original image will not have its
orientation affected.)

---
*** The 'message-valid-fqdn-regexp' variable has been removed, since
there are now top-level domains added all the time.  Message will no
longer warn about sending emails to top-level domains it hasn't heard
about.

** Enhanced xterm support

*** New variable 'xterm-set-window-title' controls whether Emacs
sets the XTerm window title.  The default is to set the window title.

---
*** New variable 'erc-default-port-tls' used to connect to TLS IRC
servers.

** URL

+++
*** The new function 'url-cookie-delete-cookie' can be used to
programmatically delete all cookies, or cookies from a specific
domain.

+++
*** 'url-retrieve-synchronously' now takes an optional timeout parameter.

---
*** The URL package now support HTTPS over proxies supporting CONNECT.

+++
*** 'url-user-agent' now defaults to 'default', and the User-Agent
string is computed dynamically based on 'url-privacy-level'.

** VC and related modes

---
*** The VC state indicator in the mode line now defaults to more
colorful faces to make it more obvious to the user what the state is.
See the 'vc-faces' customization group.

+++
*** 'vc-dir-mode' now binds 'vc-log-outgoing' to 'O'; and has various
branch-related commands on a keymap bound to 'B'.

---
*** 'vc-region-history' is now bound to 'C-x v h', replacing the older
'vc-insert-headers' binding.

** CC mode

---
*** Opening a .h file will turn C or C++ mode depending on language used.
This is done with the help of 'c-or-c++-mode' function which analyses
contents of the buffer to determine whether it's a C or C++ source
file.

---
** New DNS mode command 'dns-mode-ipv6-to-nibbles' to convert IPv6 addresses
to a format suitable for reverse lookup zone files.

** Ispell

+++
*** Enchant is now supported as a spell-checker.

Enchant is a meta-spell-checker that uses providers
such as Hunspell to do the actual checking.  With it, users can use
spell-checkers not directly supported by Emacs, such as Voikko, Hspell
and AppleSpell, more easily share personal word-lists with other
programs, and configure different spelling-checkers for different
languages.  (Version 2.1.0 or later of Enchant is required.)

** Flymake

+++
*** Emacs no longer prompts the user before killing Flymake processes on exit.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 26.1

** New package 'auth-source-pass' integrates 'auth-source' with the
password manager password-store (http://passwordstore.org).


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 26.1

---
*** password-data is now a hash-table
so that `password-read' can use any object for the `key' argument.

+++
*** Command 'dired-mark-extension' now automatically prepends a '.' to the
extension when not present.  The new command 'dired-mark-suffix' behaves
similarly but it doesn't prepend a '.'.

+++
** Certain cond/pcase/cl-case forms are now compiled using a faster jump
table implementation.  This uses a new bytecode op 'switch', which
isn't compatible with previous Emacs versions.  This functionality can
be disabled by setting 'byte-compile-cond-use-jump-table' to nil.

---
** The alist 'ucs-names' is now a hash table.

---
** 'if-let' and 'when-let' are subsumed by 'if-let*' and 'when-let*'.
The incumbent 'if-let' and 'when-let' are now marked obsolete.
'if-let*' and 'when-let*' do not accept the single tuple special case.
New macro 'and-let*' is an implementation of the Scheme SRFI-2 syntax
of the same name.  'if-let*' and 'when-let*' now accept the same
binding syntax as 'and-let*'.

---
** 'C-up', 'C-down', 'C-left' and 'C-right' are now defined in term
mode to send the same escape sequences that xterm does.  This makes
things like forward-word in readline work.

---
** hideshow mode got four key bindings that are analogous to outline
mode bindings: 'C-c @ C-a', 'C-c @ C-t', 'C-c @ C-d', and 'C-c @ C-e.'

---
** Customizable variable 'query-replace-from-to-separator'
now doesn't propertize the string value of the separator.
Instead, text properties are added by query-replace-read-from.
Additionally, the new nil value restores pre-24.5 behavior
of not providing replacement pairs via the history.

---
** Some obsolete functions, variables, and faces have been removed:
*** make-variable-frame-local.  Variables cannot be frame-local any more.
*** From subr.el: window-dot, set-window-dot, read-input, show-buffer,
eval-current-buffer, string-to-int
*** icomplete-prospects-length.
*** All the default-FOO variables that hold the default value of the
FOO variable.  Use 'default-value' and 'setq-default' to access and
change FOO, respectively.  The exhaustive list of removed variables is:
'default-mode-line-format', 'default-header-line-format',
'default-line-spacing', 'default-abbrev-mode', 'default-ctl-arrow',
'default-truncate-lines', 'default-left-margin', 'default-tab-width',
'default-case-fold-search', 'default-left-margin-width',
'default-right-margin-width', 'default-left-fringe-width',
'default-right-fringe-width', 'default-fringes-outside-margins',
'default-scroll-bar-width', 'default-vertical-scroll-bar',
'default-indicate-empty-lines', 'default-indicate-buffer-boundaries',
'default-fringe-indicator-alist', 'default-fringe-cursor-alist',
'default-scroll-up-aggressively', 'default-scroll-down-aggressively',
'default-fill-column', 'default-cursor-type',
'default-cursor-in-non-selected-windows',
'default-buffer-file-coding-system', 'default-major-mode', and
'default-enable-multibyte-characters'.
*** Many variables obsoleted in 22.1 referring to face symbols

+++
** The variable 'text-quoting-style' is now a customizable option.  It
controls whether to and how to translate ASCII quotes in messages and
help output.  Its possible values and their semantics remain unchanged
from Emacs 25.  In particular, when this variable's value is 'grave',
all quotes in formats are output as-is.

---
** Functions like 'check-declare-file' and 'check-declare-directory'
now generate less chatter and more-compact diagnostics.  The auxiliary
function 'check-declare-errmsg' has been removed.

+++
** The regular expression character class [:blank:] now matches
Unicode horizontal whitespace as defined in the Unicode Technical
Standard #18.  If you only want to match space and tab, use [ \t]
instead.

+++
** 'min' and 'max' no longer round their results.
Formerly, they returned a floating-point value if any argument was
floating-point, which was sometimes numerically incorrect.  For
example, on a 64-bit host (max 1e16 10000000000000001) now returns its
second argument instead of its first.

** The FILENAME argument to 'file-name-base' is now mandatory and no
longer defaults to 'buffer-file-name'.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 26.1

+++
** The function 'assoc' now takes an optional third argument TESTFN.
This argument, when non-nil, is used for comparison instead of
'equal'.

+++
** New optional argument TESTFN in 'alist-get', 'map-elt' and 'map-put'.
If non-nil, the argument specifies a function to use for comparison,
instead of, respectively, 'assq' and 'eql'.

+++
** New function 'seq-set-equal-p' to check if SEQUENCE1 and SEQUENCE2
contain the same elements, regardless of the order.

+++
** The new function 'mapbacktrace' applies a function to all frames of
the current stack trace.

+++
** The new function 'file-name-case-insensitive-p' tests whether a
given file is on a case-insensitive filesystem.

+++
** Several accessors for the value returned by 'file-attributes'
have been added.  They are: 'file-attribute-type',
'file-attribute-link-number', 'file-attribute-user-id',
'file-attribute-group-id', 'file-attribute-access-time',
'file-attribute-modification-time',
'file-attribute-status-change-time', 'file-attribute-size',
'file-attribute-modes', 'file-attribute-inode-number',
'file-attribute-device-number' and 'file-attribute-collect'.

+++
** The new function 'buffer-hash' computes a fast, non-consing hash of
a buffer's contents.

+++
** 'interrupt-process' now consults the list 'interrupt-process-functions',
to determine which function has to be called in order to deliver the
SIGINT signal.  This allows Tramp to send the SIGINT signal to remote
asynchronous processes.  The hitherto existing implementation has been
moved to 'internal-default-interrupt-process'.

+++
** The new function 'read-multiple-choice' prompts for multiple-choice
questions, with a handy way to display help texts.

---
** 'comment-indent-function' values may now return a cons to specify a
range of indentation.

+++
** New optional argument TEXT in 'make-temp-file'.

---
** New function `define-symbol-prop'.

** Checksum/Hash

+++
** New function 'secure-hash-algorithms' to list the algorithms that
'secure-hash' supports.
See the node "(elisp) Checksum/Hash" in the ELisp manual for details.

+++
** Emacs now exposes the GnuTLS cryptographic API with the functions
'gnutls-macs' and 'gnutls-hash-mac'; 'gnutls-digests' and
'gnutls-hash-digest'; 'gnutls-ciphers' and 'gnutls-symmetric-encrypt'
and 'gnutls-symmetric-decrypt'.
See the node "(elisp) GnuTLS Cryptography" in the ELisp manual for details.

+++
** Emacs now supports records for user-defined types, via the new
functions 'make-record', 'record', and 'recordp'.  Records are now
used internally to represent cl-defstruct and defclass instances, for
example.

+++
** 'save-some-buffers' now uses 'save-some-buffers-default-predicate'
to decide which buffers to ask about, if the PRED argument is nil.
The default value of 'save-some-buffers-default-predicate' is nil,
which means ask about all file-visiting buffers.

---
** string-(to|as|make)-(uni|multi)byte are now declared obsolete.

+++
** New variable 'while-no-input-ignore-events' which allow
setting which special events 'while-no-input' should ignore.
It is a list of symbols.

---
** New function 'undo-amalgamate-change-group' to get rid of
undo-boundaries between two states.

---
** New var 'definition-prefixes' is a hash table mapping prefixes to
the files where corresponding definitions can be found.  This can be
used to fetch definitions that are not yet loaded, for example for
'C-h f'.

---
** New var 'syntax-ppss-table' to control the syntax-table used in
'syntax-ppss'.

+++
** 'define-derived-mode' can now specify an :after-hook form, which
gets evaluated after the new mode's hook has run.  This can be used to
incorporate configuration changes made in the mode hook into the
mode's setup.

---
** Autoload files can be generated without timestamps,
by setting 'autoload-timestamps' to nil.
FIXME As an experiment, nil is the current default.
If no insurmountable problems before next release, it can stay that way.

---
** 'gnutls-boot' now takes a parameter ':complete-negotiation' that
says that negotiation should complete even on non-blocking sockets.

---
** There is now a new variable 'flyspell-sort-corrections-function'
that allows changing the way corrections are sorted.

---
** The new command 'fortune-message' has been added, which displays
fortunes in the echo area.

+++
** New function 'func-arity' returns information about the argument list
of an arbitrary function.  This generalizes 'subr-arity' for functions
that are not built-in primitives.  We recommend using this new
function instead of 'subr-arity'.

---
** New function 'region-bounds' can be used in the interactive spec
to provide region boundaries (for rectangular regions more than one)
to an interactively callable function as a single argument instead of
two separate arguments region-beginning and region-end.

+++
** 'parse-partial-sexp' state has a new element.  Element 10 is
non-nil when the last character scanned might be the first character
of a two character construct, i.e., a comment delimiter or escaped
character.  Its value is the syntax of that last character.

+++
** 'parse-partial-sexp's state, element 9, has now been confirmed as
permanent and documented, and may be used by Lisp programs.  Its value
is a list of currently open parenthesis positions, starting with the
outermost parenthesis.

---
** 'read-color' will now display the color names using the color itself
as the background color.

---
** The function 'redirect-debugging-output' now works on platforms
other than GNU/Linux.

+++
** The new function 'string-version-lessp' compares strings by
interpreting consecutive runs of numerical characters as numbers, and
compares their numerical values.  According to this predicate,
"foo2.png" is smaller than "foo12.png".

---
** Numeric comparisons and 'logb' no longer return incorrect answers
due to internal rounding errors.  For example, (< most-positive-fixnum
(+ 1.0 most-positive-fixnum)) now correctly returns t on 64-bit hosts.

---
** The functions 'ffloor', 'fceiling', 'ftruncate' and 'fround' now
accept only floating-point arguments, as per their documentation.
Formerly, they quietly accepted integer arguments and sometimes
returned nonsensical answers, e.g., (< N (ffloor N)) could return t.

---
** On hosts like GNU/Linux x86-64 where a 'long double' fraction
contains at least EMACS_INT_WIDTH - 3 bits, 'format' no longer returns
incorrect answers due to internal rounding errors when formatting
Emacs integers with %e, %f, or %g conversions.  For example, on these
hosts (eql N (string-to-number (format "%.0f" N))) now returns t for
all Emacs integers N.

---
** Calls that accept floating-point integers (for use on hosts with
limited integer range) now signal an error if arguments are not
integral.  For example (decode-char 'ascii 0.5) now signals an error.

+++
** The new function 'char-from-name' converts a Unicode name string
to the corresponding character code.

+++
** New functions 'sxhash-eq' and 'sxhash-eql' return hash codes of a
Lisp object suitable for use with 'eq' and 'eql' correspondingly.  If
two objects are 'eq' ('eql'), then the result of 'sxhash-eq'
('sxhash-eql') on them will be the same.

+++
** Function 'sxhash' has been renamed to 'sxhash-equal' for
consistency with the new functions.  For compatibility, 'sxhash'
remains as an alias to 'sxhash-equal'.

+++
** 'make-hash-table' now defaults to a rehash threshold of 0.8125
instead of 0.8, to avoid rounding glitches.

+++
** New function 'add-variable-watcher' can be used to call a function
when a symbol's value is changed.  This is used to implement the new
debugger command 'debug-on-variable-change'.

+++
** New variable 'print-escape-control-characters' causes 'prin1' and
'print' to output control characters as backslash sequences.

+++
** Time conversion functions that accept a time zone rule argument now
allow it to be OFFSET or a list (OFFSET ABBR), where the integer
OFFSET is a count of seconds east of Universal Time, and the string
ABBR is a time zone abbreviation.  The affected functions are
'current-time-string', 'current-time-zone', 'decode-time',
'format-time-string', and 'set-time-zone-rule'.

+++
** 'format-time-string' now formats "%q" to the calendar quarter.

+++
** New built-in function 'mapcan'.
It avoids unnecessary consing (and garbage collection).

+++
** 'car' and 'cdr' compositions 'cXXXr' and 'cXXXXr' are now part of Elisp.

+++
** 'gensym' is now part of Elisp.

---
** Low-level list functions like 'length' and 'member' now do a better
job of signaling list cycles instead of looping indefinitely.

+++
** The new functions 'make-nearby-temp-file' and 'temporary-file-directory'
can be used for creation of temporary files of remote or mounted directories.

+++
** On GNU platforms when operating on a local file, 'file-attributes'
no longer suffers from a race when called while another process is
altering the filesystem.  On non-GNU platforms 'file-attributes'
attempts to detect the race, and returns nil if it does so.

+++
** The new function 'file-local-name' can be used to specify arguments
of remote processes.

+++
** The new functions 'file-name-quote', 'file-name-unquote' and
'file-name-quoted-p' can be used to quote / unquote file names with
the prefix "/:".

+++
** The new error 'file-missing', a subcategory of 'file-error', is now
signaled instead of 'file-error' if a file operation acts on a file
that does not exist.

+++
** The function 'delete-directory' no longer signals an error when
operating recursively and when some other process deletes the directory
or its files before 'delete-directory' gets to them.

+++
*** New error type 'user-search-failed' like 'search-failed' but
avoids debugger like 'user-error'.

+++
** The function 'line-number-at-pos' now takes a second optional
argument 'absolute'.  If this parameter is nil, the default, this
function keeps on returning the line number taking potential narrowing
into account.  If this parameter is non-nil, the function ignores
narrowing and returns the absolute line number.

---
** The function 'color-distance' now takes a second optional argument
'metric'.  When non-nil, it should be a function of two arguments that
accepts two colors and returns a number.

** Changes in Frame and Window Handling

+++
*** Resizing a frame no longer runs 'window-configuration-change-hook'.
'window-size-change-functions' should be used instead.

+++
*** The new function 'frame-size-changed-p' can tell whether a frame has
been resized since the last time 'window-size-change-functions' has been
run.

+++
*** The function 'frame-geometry' now also returns the width of a
frame's outer border.

+++
*** New frame parameters and changed semantics for older ones

+++
**** 'z-group' positions a frame above or below all others.

+++
**** 'min-width' and 'min-height' specify the absolute minimum size of a
frame.

+++
**** 'parent-frame' makes a frame the child frame of another Emacs
frame.  The section "Child Frames" in the Elisp manual describes the
intrinsics of that relationship.

+++
**** 'delete-before' triggers deletion of one frame before that of
another.

+++
**** 'mouse-wheel-frame' specifies another frame whose windows shall be
scrolled instead.

+++
**** 'no-other-frame' has 'next-frame' and 'previous-frame' skip this
frame.

+++
**** 'skip-taskbar' removes a frame's icon from the taskbar and has
Alt-<TAB> skip this frame.

+++
**** 'no-focus-on-map' avoids that a frame gets input focus when mapped.

+++
**** 'no-accept-focus' means that a frame does not want to get input
focus via the mouse.

+++
**** 'undecorated' removes the window manager decorations from a frame.

+++
**** 'override-redirect' tells the window manager to disregard this
frame.

+++
**** 'width' and 'height' allow to specify pixel values and ratios now.

+++
**** 'left' and 'top' allow to specify ratios now.

+++
**** 'keep-ratio' preserves size and position of child frames when their
parent frame is resized.

+++
**** 'no-special-glyphs' suppresses display of truncation and
continuation glyphs in a frame.

+++
**** 'auto-hide-function' and 'minibuffer-exit' handle auto hiding of
frames and exiting from minibuffer individually.

+++
**** 'fit-frame-to-buffer-margins' and 'fit-frame-to-buffer-sizes'
handle fitting a frame to its buffer individually.

+++
**** 'drag-internal-border', 'drag-with-header-line',
'drag-with-mode-line', 'snap-width', 'top-visible' and 'bottom-visible'
allow to drag and resize frames with the mouse.

*** The new function 'frame-list-z-order' returns a list of all frames
in Z (stacking) order.

+++
*** The function 'x-focus-frame' optionally tries to not activate its
frame.

+++
*** The variable 'focus-follows-mouse' has a third meaningful value
'auto-raise' to indicate that the window manager automatically raises a
frame when the mouse pointer enters it.

+++
*** The new function 'frame-restack' puts a frame above or below
another on the display.

+++
*** The new face 'internal-border' specifies the background of a frame's
internal border.

+++
*** The NORECORD argument of 'select-window' now has a meaningful value
'mark-for-redisplay' which is like any other non-nil value but marks
WINDOW for redisplay.

+++
*** Support for side windows is now official.
The display action function 'display-buffer-in-side-window' will
display its buffer in a side window.  Functions for toggling all side
windows on a frame, changing and reversing the layout of side windows
and returning the main (major non-side) window of a frame are
provided.  For details consult the section "Side Windows" in the Elisp
manual.

+++
*** Support for atomic windows - rectangular compositions of windows
treated by 'split-window', 'delete-window' and 'delete-other-windows'
like a single live window - is now official.  For details consult the
section "Atomic Windows" in the Elisp manual.

+++
*** New 'display-buffer' alist entry 'window-parameters' allows to
assign window parameters to the window used for displaying the buffer.

+++
*** New function 'display-buffer-reuse-mode-window' is an action function
suitable for use in 'display-buffer-alist'.  For example, to avoid
creating a new window when opening man pages when there's already one,
use

(add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
     '("\\`\\*Man .*\\*\\'" .
       (display-buffer-reuse-mode-window
        (inhibit-same-window . nil)
        (mode . Man-mode))))

+++
*** New window parameter 'no-delete-other-windows' prevents that
its window gets deleted by 'delete-other-windows'.

+++
*** New window parameters 'mode-line-format' and 'header-line-format'
allow to override the buffer-local formats for this window.

+++
*** New command 'window-swap-states' swaps the states of two live
windows.

+++
*** New functions 'window-pixel-width-before-size-change' and
'window-pixel-height-before-size-change' support detecting which
window changed size when 'window-size-change-functions' are run.

+++
*** The new function 'window-lines-pixel-dimensions' returns the pixel
dimensions of a window's text lines.

+++
*** The new function 'window-largest-empty-rectangle' returns the
dimensions of the largest rectangular area not occupying any text in a
window's body.

+++
*** The semantics of 'mouse-autoselect-window' has changed slightly.
For details see the section "Mouse Window Auto-selection" in the Elisp
manual.

---
** 'tcl-auto-fill-mode' is now declared obsolete.  Its functionality
can be replicated simply by setting 'comment-auto-fill-only-comments'.

** New pcase pattern 'rx' to match against a rx-style regular expression.
For details, see the doc string of 'rx--pcase-macroexpander'.

---
** New functions to set region from secondary selection and vice versa.
The new functions 'secondary-selection-to-region' and
'secondary-selection-from-region' let you set the beginning and the
end of the region from those of the secondary selection and vise
versa.


* Changes in Emacs 26.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

+++
** Intercepting hotkeys on Windows 7 and later now works better.
The new keyboard hooking code properly grabs system hotkeys such as
Win-* and Alt-TAB, in a way that Emacs can get at them before the
system.  This makes the 'w32-register-hot-key' functionality work
again on all versions of MS-Windows starting with Windows 7.  On
Windows NT and later you can now register any hotkey combination.  (On
Windows 9X, the previous limitations, spelled out in the Emacs manual,
still apply.)

---
** 'convert-standard-filename' no longer mirrors slashes on MS-Windows.
Previously, on MS-Windows this function converted slash characters in
file names into backslashes.  It no longer does that.  If your Lisp
program used 'convert-standard-filename' to prepare file names to be
passed to subprocesses (which is not the recommended usage of that
function), you will now have to mirror slashes in your application
code.  One possible way is this:

         (let ((start 0))
           (while (string-match "/" file-name start)
             (aset file-name (match-beginning 0) ?\\)
             (setq start (match-end 0))))

---
** GUI sessions on MS-Windows now treat SIGINT like Posix platforms do.
The effect of delivering a Ctrl-C (SIGINT) signal to a GUI Emacs on
MS-Windows is now the same as on Posix platforms -- Emacs saves the
session and exits.  In particular, this will happen if you start
emacs.exe from the Windows shell, then type Ctrl-C into that shell's
window.

---
** 'signal-process' supports SIGTRAP on Windows XP and later.
The 'kill' emulation on Windows now maps SIGTRAP to a call to the
'DebugBreakProcess' API.  This causes the receiving process to break
execution and return control to the debugger.  If no debugger is
attached to the receiving process, the call is typically ignored.
This is in contrast to the default action on POSIX Systems, where it
causes the receiving process to terminate with a core dump if no
debugger has been attached to it.

---
** 'set-mouse-position' and 'set-mouse-absolute-pixel-position' work
on macOS.

---
** Emacs can now be run as a GUI application from the command line on
macOS.

+++
** 'ns-appearance' and 'ns-transparent-titlebar' change the appearance
of frame decorations on macOS 10.9+.

---
** 'ns-use-thin-smoothing' enables thin font smoothing on macOS 10.8+.

---
** 'process-attributes' on Darwin systems now returns more information.

---
** Mousewheel and trackpad scrolling on macOS 10.7+ now behaves more
like the macOS default.  The new variables 'ns-mwheel-line-height',
'ns-use-mwheel-acceleration' and 'ns-use-mwheel-momentum' can be used
to customize the behavior.

---
** Battery status is now supported in all Cygwin builds.
Previously it was supported only in the Cygwin-w32 build.

** Emacs now handles key combinations involving the macOS "command"
and "option" modifier keys more correctly.

** The special handling of `frame-title-format' on NS where setting it
to `t' would enable the macOS proxy icon has been replaced with a
separate variable, `ns-use-proxy-icon'. `frame-title-format' will now
work as on other platforms.
