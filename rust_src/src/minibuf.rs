/// and `completion-boundaries', for more details on completion,
/// COLLECTION, and PREDICATE.  See also Info nodes `(elisp)Basic Completion'
/// for the details about completion, and `(elisp)Programmed Completion' for
/// expectations from COLLECTION when it's a function.
///
/// REQUIRE-MATCH can take the following values:
/// - t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
///   the input is (or completes to) an element of COLLECTION or is null.
/// - nil means that the user can exit with any input.
/// - `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
///   to confirm her choice if the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
/// - `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
///   input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
///   `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
///   and the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
/// - anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
///   does non-null completion.
///
/// If the input is null, `completing-read' returns DEF, or the first element
/// of the list of default values, or an empty string if DEF is nil,
/// regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.
///
/// If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
///   with point positioned at the end.
///   If it is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input is STRING, but point
///   is placed at _zero-indexed_ position POSITION in STRING.  (*Note*
///   that this is different from `read-from-minibuffer' and related
///   functions, which use one-indexing for POSITION.)  This feature is
///   deprecated--it is best to pass nil for INITIAL-INPUT and supply the
///   default value DEF instead.  The user can yank the default value into
///   the minibuffer easily using \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
///
/// HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally the initial
///   position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the history list
///   variable to use, or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In
///   that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and HISTPOS
///   is the initial position (the position in the list used by the
///   minibuffer history commands).  For consistency, you should also
///   specify that element of the history as the value of
///   INITIAL-INPUT.  (This is the only case in which you should use
///   INITIAL-INPUT instead of DEF.)  Positions are counted starting from
///   1 at the beginning of the list.  The variable `history-length'
///   controls the maximum length of a history list.
///
/// DEF, if non-nil, is the default value or the list of default values.
///
/// If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits
///   the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.
///
/// Completion ignores case if the ambient value of
///   `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil.
///
/// See also `completing-read-function'.
