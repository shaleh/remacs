/// Call PROGRAM synchronously in separate process.
/// The remaining arguments are optional.
/// The program's input comes from file INFILE (nil means `/dev/null').
/// Insert output in DESTINATION before point; t means current buffer; nil for DESTINATION
/// means discard it; 0 means discard and don't wait; and `(:file FILE)', where
/// FILE is a file name string, means that it should be written to that file
/// (if the file already exists it is overwritten).
/// DESTINATION can also have the form (REAL-BUFFER STDERR-FILE); in that case,
/// REAL-BUFFER says what to do with standard output, as above,
/// while STDERR-FILE says what to do with standard error in the child.
/// STDERR-FILE may be nil (discard standard error output),
/// t (mix it with ordinary output), or a file name string.
///
/// Fourth arg DISPLAY non-nil means redisplay buffer as output is inserted.
/// Remaining arguments are strings passed as command arguments to PROGRAM.
///
/// If executable PROGRAM can't be found as an executable, `call-process'
/// signals a Lisp error.  `call-process' reports errors in execution of
/// the program only through its return and output.
///
/// If DESTINATION is 0, `call-process' returns immediately with value nil.
/// Otherwise it waits for PROGRAM to terminate
/// and returns a numeric exit status or a signal description string.
/// If you quit, the process is killed with SIGINT, or SIGKILL if you quit again.
///
/// The process runs in `default-directory' if that is local (as
/// determined by `unhandled-file-name-directory'), or "~" otherwise.  If
/// you want to run a process in a remote directory use `process-file'.
///
/// usage: (call-process PROGRAM &optional INFILE DESTINATION DISPLAY &rest ARGS)
