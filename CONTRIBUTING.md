Thank you for contributing to Remacs!

## Getting Started

* Consider filing an issue or leaving a note on an existing issue, to
  avoid overlapping with someone else.
* Work in progress PRs are welcome, if you want review or if you get
  stuck. Just put [WIP] in the PR title, and remove [WIP] when you're
  happy.

## Writing a great Pull Request (PR)

* Check for Rust compiler warnings, as Travis won't go green if there
  are warnings.
* Format your code with
  [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt).
* Add docstrings to your Rust functions `/// This function does ...`
* _Really_ great PRs include tests. Don't worry if it's not
  possible to write tests for your code yet (this is common).

## Getting your PRs merged

* Your PR needs to be reviewed by a collaborator. The following users
  can do this for you: @Wilfred @c-nixon @CrLF0710 @jeandudey
* The build needs to be passing.
